# Influences

Crust language was built upon many insights gathered while developing [Cairo].

Most of the syntax and many design elements have been inspired on [Rust].
This document itself has also been largely based on [The Rust Reference] and many definitions have
been borrowed from it.

Some other influences are listed below:

- Python: multiline strings
- [Unicode Annex #31](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr31/): identifier and pattern syntax
