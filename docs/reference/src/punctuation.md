## Delimiters

Bracket punctuation is used in various parts of the grammar.
An open bracket must always be paired with a close bracket.
The three types of brackets are:

| Bracket | Type            |
|---------|-----------------|
| `{` `}` | Curly braces    |
| `[` `]` | Square brackets |
| `(` `)` | Parentheses     |
